What is Docker?
==> 
Docker is a set of platform as a service (PAAS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.
The software that hosts the containers is called Docker Engine.
Docker implements containerization.

Docker Architecture:
==>
1. Docker daemon process is the brain of docker. (please refer 3.docker-architecture image)
The Docker daemon (dockerd) listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes. A daemon can also communicate with other daemons to manage Docker services.
